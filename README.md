# oo_backprop
A teeny library to implement a backprop neural network in object-oriented style, originally written for a project in a neural networks modeling course.

This library has a NetworkLogger class to handle data capture and saving, and classes for the network components itself. Example uses can be found in the run_backprop.py file.
